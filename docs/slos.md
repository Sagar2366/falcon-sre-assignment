# Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Monitoring

## Overview

This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs), and monitoring strategies for the SRE Assessment project.

## Service Level Objectives

- **Service Availability**: 99.9% of time service is responding to health checks
- **Infrastructure Availability**: 99.95% of EKS cluster nodes are healthy

**Measurement**:
- **Time Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 0.1% (43.2 minutes per month)
- **Alerting**: Alert when error budget consumption exceeds 50%

### 2. Latency SLO

**Objective**: P95 response time < 200ms

**SLIs**:
- **Response Time**: 95th percentile of HTTP request response times

## Alerting Strategy

### 1. Critical Alerts (P0)

**Immediate Response Required**

# High Error Rate
- condition: error_rate > 1%
- action: page on-call engineer
- escalation: 5 minutes

# Cost Exceeded
- condition: monthly_cost > budget * 1.2

- escalation: 30 minutes
```

### 2. Warning Alerts (P1)

**Response Required Within 1 Hour**

```yaml
# High Latency
- condition: p95_latency > 200ms
- action: notify on-call engineer
- escalation: 1 hour

# Resource Utilization
- condition: cpu_utilization > 80%
- action: notify on-call engineer
- escalation: 30 minutes

# Error Budget Consumption
